## ðŸ“Œ Project Background

This project explores the **Crunchbase startup investment dataset** to uncover trends in how startups are funded and which sectors receive the most investor attention. By merging Crunchbaseâ€™s internal startup data with an external investor dataset, we identified patterns in funding behavior, investor preferences, and startup progression through funding rounds.

## ðŸ§  Hypothesis

Startups in tech-centric sectors like Software, Biotechnology, and Mobile:
- Receive the most early-stage investments
- Are more likely to progress to Series C and beyond
- Show a higher rate of sustainable operation or acquisition

Our hypothesis: Early investment in innovation-driven startups is a strong predictor of long-term success.

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Methodology

We used Python-based libraries such as:
- `pandas` for data manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` for data visualization  

Visuals included:
- Market trends by startup count and total funding  
- Investor dominance and activity levels  
- Startup lifecycle through funding rounds (Funnel & Sankey Charts)  
- Success rate by sector and investment timing

## ðŸ”— Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Key Visual Insights

- Top Markets: Software, Biotechnology, and Mobile dominate in both number and funding volume.  
- Funding Rounds: Drop-off occurs significantly after Series C, showing importance of early backing.  
- Startup Outcomes: 80%+ are operating, and many are acquired â€” indicating success.  
- Investor Trends: Top investors focus heavily on tech, confirming our hypothesis.

## âœ… Conclusion

Our visualizations strongly support the idea that early investment in innovation-heavy startups leads to better outcomes. The startup world favors technology and biotech, and those who receive solid early backing often achieve longevity or successful exits.
